# School District Analysis
## Overview
### Description:
In this project, we are looking at high schools, identifying school funding based on how their students perform on standardized tests. We will be looking at the student's tests scores on reading and math to help provide some insight on how they perform and identify any trends.

### Purpose:
The purpose of the analysis will be to provide information to a school board on how various schools are doing in math and reading while maintaining privacy per student. 

### Situation
The School Board has noticed that there has been evidence of academic dishonesty coming from Thomas High School, particularly from the 9th grade class. We will be removing their data from this analysis while keeping the rest of the data. 

### Approach:
We will be using Python and Pandas in order to clean, merge and analyze the data and provide statistical information.

## Analysis and Results
### District Summary:
As per request from the School Board, we have removed the 9th graders from Thomas High School in this report. Prior to removing them from our analysis, the school disctrict performaces were as such: <br>

In comparison, after removing the 9th grader data set, the data set now looks like as such: <br>

In looking at the 2 images, we noticed that the % passing math went down by 0.2% and the average score went down by .1 point. The passing % for reading went down by 0.3% but the average point remained the same. As for overall passing, the average passing went down by 0.1%.
